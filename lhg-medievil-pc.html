It was on PC, pretty sure that it was on Windows98. I played it during the early 2000s, when I was a very small kid, but it could have come out a few years before. I only remember bits and pieces (I was quite young) but I'll try to make sense: It was 3D (or maybe 2D with 3D sprites?) and very low res/pixelated. It had a top down view and the world sort of. scrolled? like in animal crossing, it was as if you were walking on a huge sphere. There were several characters to play as, I'm pretty. 
Here's a video of me playing Medievil Resurrection on the jpcsp PSP emulator. First off. Good Points: The graphics look great fullscreen! It just shows how much it needed porting. It popped into my head earlier and I'm trying to figure out what it was. I didn't own it and only remember watching a friend play it. I want to say it combat/control wise it was like a primitive mix of Dark Souls and Tomb Raider. Maybe it was barbarian related? I know that you could dismember enemies etc. There may have been some minor exploration elements. Thanks folks.
